The CheckTie function:

The checkTie function in your Tic-Tac-Toe program is designed to determine if the game has resulted in a tie (or draw). 
Here’s how it works, step by step:

Purpose: The function checks if all the spaces on the board are filled without any player winning, which indicates a tie.

Loop Through Spaces: It uses a for loop that iterates through all the indices of the spaces array (which represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board). The array has 9 elements, each representing a cell on the board.

- Check for Empty Spaces:

Inside the loop, it checks if any of the spaces are still empty (i.e., if the space at index i is equal to ' ').
If it finds any empty space, it immediately returns false, indicating that the game is not yet a tie because there are still available moves.
All Spaces Filled: If the loop completes and finds no empty spaces (i.e., all spaces are filled), it means the game cannot continue. At this point:

It prints "IT'S A TIE!\n" to inform the players of the result.
It then returns true to indicate that the game ended in a tie.
Here’s the relevant code for the checkTie function:

Summary:
->The function checks all board spaces.
->If it finds an empty space, it returns false.
->If all spaces are filled and no winner has been declared, it prints a tie message and returns true.

This function checks all possible winning combinations and prints the result based on the current state of the board.

Some of the Parameters are:
spaces: A pointer to an array of characters that represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board (9 elements).
player: The character representing the player (usually 'X').
computer: The character representing the computer (usually 'O').

Logic Breakdown
The function checks each possible winning condition in a sequence of if-else statements. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Winning Combinations: There are eight possible ways to win:

Rows:
Row 1: spaces[0], spaces[1], spaces[2]
Row 2: spaces[3], spaces[4], spaces[5]
Row 3: spaces[6], spaces[7], spaces[8]
Columns:
Column 1: spaces[0], spaces[3], spaces[6]
Column 2: spaces[1], spaces[4], spaces[7]
Column 3: spaces[2], spaces[5], spaces[8]
Diagonals:
Diagonal 1: spaces[0], spaces[4], spaces[8]
Diagonal 2: spaces[2], spaces[4], spaces[6]
Checking Conditions:

Each condition checks if the first space in a combination is not empty (' ') to ensure that a potential win is valid.
If the condition is met, it checks if all spaces in that combination are equal.
It uses the ternary operator (? :) to print "YOU WIN!" if the player has won or "YOU LOSE!" if the computer has won.

Specific Conditions

What It Does: Checks if spaces 0, 1, and 2 form a winning combination. If they do, it evaluates who the winner is.
Return Values
If a winning condition is met, the function does not return a value immediately; instead, it prints the result and falls through to the end.
If no winning conditions are satisfied, it reaches the else statement, which returns false, indicating that no winner has been found yet.

Finally,
The checkWinner function effectively encapsulates the logic for determining the winner by:
Checking all winning combinations on the board.
Printing out the result based on the character in the winning spots.
Returning a boolean value to indicate whether the game has been won or not.

Possible Improvements
Reduce Redundancy: The current implementation has a lot of repetitive code. Instead of separate if-else statements, you could use an array of winning combinations and iterate through them.
Clearer Return Logic: Currently, the function prints the win/loss messages directly. You could modify it to return a value indicating the winner (or NONE for no winner) and handle the printing in the main game loop for better separation of concerns.

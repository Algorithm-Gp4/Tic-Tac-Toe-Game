The drawBoard function is responsible for displaying the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board to the console.

 It takes a pointer to a character array (char *spaces), which represents the board's spaces, as its parameter. 
Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Formatting Output: The function uses a series of cout statements to create a visual representation of the board. 
                   Each of the nine spaces is represented by a character from the spaces array,
                   which can either be 'X', 'O', or a space character ' ' if that spot is unoccupied.

Layout: The board is displayed in a 3x3 grid format:

It begins and ends with a row of vertical bars and spaces.
Each of the three rows contains three spaces (using the characters from the spaces array), separated by vertical bars (|).
Horizontal lines (_____) are drawn between the rows to delineate them clearly.
Spacing: Additional new line characters (\n) are used to provide spacing before and after the board, 
ensuring that the output is visually distinct and easy to read.

In summary,
 the drawBoard function effectively presents the game state in a user-friendly format,
 helping players visualize the current configuration of the game.

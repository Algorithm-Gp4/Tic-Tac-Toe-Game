# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
a tic-tac-toe game with algorithm and storage implementation

Question

 Design and implement a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that utilizes fundamental data 
structures and algorithms. Discuss the choices made in terms of data storage and 
algorithm selection.

The program has five functions. each of the functions are explained one by one. 

The main program is saved as " TTTGame.cpp "

A drawBoard function ( drawBoard())
   "Drawb.cpp" is the code with the discription " drawboard discription.txt " 
A playerMove function (plaerMove())
   "playermove.cpp" is the code with the discription "Explanation on playerMove function.txt"
A computerMove function (computerMove())
   "computerMove.cpp" is the code with the discription "Explanation-on-computerMove.txt"
A winnerCheck function (checkWinner())
   "WinnerCheck.cpp" is the code with the discription "Explanation of winner check.txt"
A tieChecking function (checkTie())
  "Checktie.cpp" is the code with discription "Check Tie.txt"


  The algorithm and storage choice is uploaded as "How The Algorithm Works.txt" and 
  "About The Storage Choice.txt" respectively

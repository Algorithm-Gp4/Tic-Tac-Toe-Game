ABOUT THE ALGORITHM

The game operates with a 'Minimax algorithm' implemented for the computer’s moves. Using Minimax provides a more challenging opponent, as it enables the computer to play optimally. To either win or force a tie.

->The Minimax Algorithm:
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive, decision-making approach used in turn-based games to minimize the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. For a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe, it explores all potential moves, predicting outcomes for each to determine the most advantageous path. This allows the computer to select moves that maximize its chance of winning or, at the very least, avoiding a loss.

How Minimax Works in Tic-Tac-Toe
Scoring the End States:

Win: If a particular game state results in a win for the computer, the algorithm assigns it a positive score (e.g., +1).
Loss: If the state results in a win for the player, it assigns a negative score (e.g., -1).
Tie: If the game results in a tie, it assigns a neutral score (0).
Recursion and Backtracking:

For each available move, the algorithm simulates placing a marker in an empty cell.
It then recursively evaluates the outcome if the other player (human or computer) takes their turn next. This process continues until the game reaches a terminal state (win, loss, or tie).
Once a terminal state is reached, the Minimax algorithm backtracks, evaluating each choice by calculating scores to identify the best possible move.
Optimal Move Selection:

The algorithm selects moves that maximize the computer’s score and minimize the player's score.
On the computer's turn, it chooses the move with the highest score (maximize); on the player's turn, it considers the lowest score to minimize the potential gain of the opponent.
Code Outline with Minimax
Here’s how Minimax would fit into the structure of the game:

- Minimax Function: A recursive function that calculates the score of each potential move, taking in the game state and current player.

The function recursively explores each move and scores it, returning the maximum score for the computer or the minimum score for the player.
Base cases in the recursion are winning, losing, or tied board states, which are assigned scores as described above.
Computer Move Using Minimax:

In the computerMove function, instead of a random choice, the algorithm finds the optimal move by evaluating the Minimax scores for each possible cell.
The computer places its marker in the cell that yields the highest Minimax score.
Advantages of Minimax in Tic-Tac-Toe
With Minimax, the computer will:

Always choose the best move, either winning or forcing a tie.
Make no random choices, ensuring consistency and predictability.
Challenge the player by not allowing easy wins, ideal for enhancing gameplay difficulty.
Limitations of Minimax
Performance: Minimax is computationally intensive for larger games but is manageable for a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
Predictability: Minimax plays perfectly, which may make the game predictable if the player learns the computer’s strategy.

Implementing Minimax in this Tic-Tac-Toe game transforms the computer from a random-moving opponent into a challenging adversary that never loses. This strategic depth makes the game more engaging for the player, as they must also think a few moves ahead to avoid losing. This implementation is excellent for demonstrating AI strategy in simple games, giving players a taste of algorithm-driven decision-making in competitive scenarios.

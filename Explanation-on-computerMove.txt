The computermove function:

The purpose of computerMove is to allow the computer to make a move by placing its marker 
(usually 'O') in a randomly chosen empty spot on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

->Random Number Generation:

The function generates a random integer between 0 and 8 using rand() % 9.
This corresponds to the indices of the spaces array, which represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board (with indices 0 to 8 for the 9 positions).


->Infinite Loop:

The function enters an infinite loop (while (true)) to continuously attempt to place a marker until it finds an empty space.
Check for Empty Space:

Inside the loop, it checks if the randomly selected position (spaces[number]) is empty (i.e., it contains a space character ' ').


->Place the Marker:

If the selected space is empty, it places the computer's marker (the character passed as the computer parameter, typically 'O')
 in that space.

->Exit the Loop:

After successfully placing the marker, the break statement is executed,
 which exits the loop, allowing the game to continue with the next turn.
Summary:
In summary, the computerMove function allows the computer to make a move in the Tic-Tac-Toe game by randomly selecting an empty spot on the board and placing its marker there. 
The function ensures that the computer does not overwrite any existing markers by checking for empty spaces before placing its marker.
